                    <a href="http://themotelmellow.com/russian-constructivism/" target="_blank">Russian Constructivism website</a><br>
                    In the first module within basic web we learned the basics of HTML and CSS, how to structure a page, what tags are and how to mark the content with them. The website’s theme was given, along with the text and images we had to use to build it. After planning the visuals in Adobe XD, we had to create the webpage for narrow-view screens, placing and transforming the content with the help of classes and id’s (fig.1).

                    The third module assignment consisted of building a responsive website of our chosen topic with multiple pages after immense design preparations, starting with a moodboard and styletile where we had to include everything from colors, to fonts, to textures, to feelings. There were three styles we had to choose one from and create the website design according to.<br>
                    My chosen style was minimalism for the theme time travel so I wanted the website to contain very simple and light colors, mostly off-white, grey and some black, no texture and clean fonts for the text.<br> 
                    The wireframe (fig.2) is a low-fidelity sketch of what the final site is going to look like, preferably for both desktop and mobile view. I planned three pages in addition to the home page, about time travel, types of time travel and time machines. In the figma prototype (fig.3) I visualized the grid that I was going to build in CSS, the navigation bar, the logo and other design elements I wanted to use. The final page included simple drawings to illustrate the content of the text.<br> 
                    Part of the assignment was to design a logo for the website in Adobe Illustrator and use it in SVG format (all other design elements had to be in SVG format as well). I decided on a simple logo that’s consisting of 2 letter T’s – as in time travel – warped in a way that’s similar to my visualization of time travel as reflected in the illustrations.

                    This module focused on target audiences and their needs so we started learning about research methods. With the help of desk research, surveys, observation and interview, enough data can be gathered to build up a problem that needs solution. This theme is about user experiences so we had to give a solution to our target group that improves their experiences using a certain product. The assignment was a groupd project and with my team we successfully identified a problem within the online t-shirt shopping experience: that sizes are not inclusive enough.<br>
                See my data collection <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAErYvuZXpg/03Qf9aV-dpRNoa1b3BcMrA/view?website#2:interview-insights" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    In the idea generation part of the project we brainstormed individually as well as together, and collected the best design solutions as a start to build up a website (fig.5). These ideas included how the photos of the models and t-shirts should look like, what sizes we should use and how to display all elements of the website in the most user-friendly way possible.<br>
                The first sketch was followed by a paper prototype where we could test with the think aloud test whether others find our solutions as self-explanatory as we intended (fig.6).

                    Since we didn’t have to build an actual website, the final stage of the project was the <a  href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/ba8d661a-798e-4bed-a8eb-119777d5bd5a-efde/?fullscreen" target=" _blank">Adobe XD prototype</a> (fig.7) and pitching our idea. In our solution we included as many body types in wearing the same products as possible, so everyone can see how it would look on them. We also emphasised the importance of our reviews from previous customers which makes the shop seem more trustworthy and leads to higher customer satisfaction.</p>

                        In the third theme of the semester we returned to coding and got introduced to Javascript. 
                        Our assignment was to create a website with a game, in which there are good elements and bad elements, so when the user clicks the good elements they earn a point and when they click a bad element, they lose a life. Meanwhile, a timer is set for the duration of the game, so it’s also lost at time out. 
                        </p>

                    <p id="ad">
                        The first task was to come up with a „story”, where is it set, who is our character and what’s at stake, what is the goal of the game, what are the good and bad elements. We had to demonstrate our ideas with a paper prototype, explaining how the game would work.<br> 
                        I decided on a game where a three-legged dog insults the user until they learn all prime numbers between 1 and 100. The numbers appear on a TV screen, the dog is sitting in a beanie and sunglasses, watching. The numbers appear in a random order and change every 7 seconds. The player needs to click on 19 prime numbers in 1 minute to win, but if 3 non-primes are clicked, the game is lost.

                    <p id="ass">
                        We got started with character and background design in Adobe Illustrator, I started my sketches of the dog and the room on paper, and tried out different color schemes digitally before choosing one (fig.8). I based mine on the visuals of Wes Anderson movies, which is also reflected in my moodboard for the game. 
                        At the same time we had to showcase the logic of our game with the help of the Activity Diagram (fig.9). It shows all the events that happen and all the choices the player has at any given moment.<br>
                        Actually coding the game was the main part of the theme. We learned CSS animations and Javascript functions, event listeners, hidden screens, transformations, how to implement sound and set a timer.<br> 
                        The finished game had to include our own illustrations as SVG’s, for the buttons, timer and score meter as well (fig.10). The website itself included five screens; a start screen, a game screen, a game over screen, a game won screen and an instructions screen.

                        The theme started with a short and quick assignment where we had to create a one minute video that tells a short story without words. I had a red vintage phone at home and the idea struck me to use it in my story as a replacement for my smartphone, since we, apparently, broke up (fig.11). It had to be edited in Adobe Premiere Pro, which I’ve used before but still challenged me.

                        For the main assignment of the theme, we had a meeting with the founders of Free Fridge Copenhagen, to get to know them and what kind of content they need, what problems need solutions. We gathered from the client meeting that their main focus is on getting more volunteers and more donations.<br>
                        My group decided to focus on donations, after the data in our survey showed that more people are willing to donate food than volunteer in their free time. These people became our target audience. After we had a clear idea about what our video is going to be about, we started pre-production.

                    <p id="pitch">
                        In the treatment we decided on a title, a theme, a logline, and gave a short description of what is going to happen in our story. We wanted to put emphasis on emotions, so the story video became simple and something most people can relate to.<br>
                        The storyboard helped us visionize how it’s all going to look like (fig.12). We learned about composition, camera movement, how to frame shots, and what kind of cuts there are. The storyboard specified the length of each shot, location, characters, props, music and sounds.<br>

                        This was followed by the shooting and editing of the video, which had to be in perfect sync of the emotional background music and with a color correction that makes it more saturated and warm. During the customer pitch we reflected on the problems that the client initially had, and showed how our content is a solution to that (fig.13).
